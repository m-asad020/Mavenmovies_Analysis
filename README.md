# Mavenmovies Analysis using MySQL
# The Situation:
You and your business partner were recently approached by another local business owner who is interested in purchasing Maven movies. He primarily owns restaurant and bars, so he has lots of questions for you about your business and rental business in general. His offer seems very generous, so you are going to entertain his questions.
# The Objective:
Use MySQL to leverage your SQL skills to extract and analyze data from various tables in the Maven Movies database to answer your potential Acquirer's questions. Each question will require you to write a multi-table SQL query, joining at least two tables.
